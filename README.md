# Zit

This is a small libraries that simplifies building web components.
It is inspired by [Lit](https://lit.dev).

Zit has fewer features that Lit.
In exchange, Zit:

- is much smaller than Lit
- doesn't require any tooling
- doesn't require a build process

The main features of Zit are that it
automates wiring event listeners
and automates implementing reactivity.

TODO: Add detail on how the main features are used
and how they work under the hood.
